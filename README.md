# NixOS in Production

This is a work-in-progress book
[hosted on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/nixos-in-production) about introducing
and maintaining NixOS in a production environment.

I believe that digital scarcity is bullshit, so I made this book freely
available under a
[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
That license covers both the source materials stored within this repository and
the [LeanPub edition](https://leanpub.com/nixos-in-production) of this book.

However, you can still show appreciation for the work I've done by purchasing
the LeanPub edition of this book.  Not only did I write this book, but I've
contributed several improvements to the Nix ecosystem along the way to
streamline the NixOS development experience documented in this book, including:

- [Improved Terraform support for NixOS](https://www.haskellforall.com/2023/01/terraform-nixos-ng-modern-terraform.html)
- [Nixpkgs support for Linux builders on macOS](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/12/nixpkgs-support-for-linux-builders.html)

I've also paid out of pocket for all professional services for this book and
self-published so that this book can remain free and be published under an open
license.

I will eventually release a separate print edition of this book with more
professional layout services.  If you purchase the LeanPub edition of this book
you can contact me and I will discount whatever you paid from the purchase price
of the print edition.
