# What is NixOS for?

Some NixOS users might try to "convert" others to NixOS using a pitch that goes something like this:

> NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager.  It uses declarative configuration and allows reliable system upgrades.
>
> Source: [Wikipedia - NixOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS)

This sort of feature-oriented description explains what NixOS *does*, but does not quite explain what NixOS *is for*.  What sort of useful things can you do with NixOS?  When is NixOS the best solution?  What types of projects, teams, or organizations should prefer using NixOS over other the alternatives?

Come to think of it, what *are* the alternatives?  Is NixOS supposed to replace Debian?  Or Docker?  Or Ansible?  Or Vagrant?  Where does NixOS fit in within the modern software landscape?

In this chapter I'll help you better understand when you should recommend NixOS to others and (just as important!) when you should gently nudge people away from NixOS.  Hopefully this chapter will improve your overall understanding of NixOS's "niche".

## Desktop vs. Server

The title of this book might have tipped you off that I will endorse NixOS for use as a server operating system rather than a desktop operating system.

I would not confidently recommend NixOS as a desktop operating system because:

- *NixOS expects users to be developers who are more hands-on with their system*

  NixOS does not come preinstalled on most computers and the installation guide assumes quite a bit of technical proficiency.  For example, NixOS is typically configured via text files and upgrades are issued from the command line.


- *Nixpkgs doesn't enjoy mainstream support for desktop-oriented applications*

  ‚Ä¶ especially games and productivity tools.  Nixpkgs is a fairly large software distribution, especially compared to other Linux software distributions, but most desktop applications will not support the Nix ecosystem out-of-the-box and non-technical users rely on experts to package things on their behalf.


- *The NixOS user experience differs from what most desktop users expect*

  Most desktop users (especially non-technical users) expect to install packages by either downloading the package from the publisher's web page or by visiting an "app store" of some sort.  They don't expect to modify a text configuration file in order to install package.


However, the above limitations don't apply when using NixOS as a server
operating system:

- *Servers are managed by technical users comfortable with the command-line*

  Server operating systems are often [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer) machines that only support a command-line interface.  In fact, a typical Ops team would likely frown upon managing a server in any other way.


- *Nixpkgs provides amazing support for server-oriented software and services*

  `nginx`, `postgres`, `redis`, ‚Ä¶ you name it, Nixpkgs most likely has the service you need and it's a dream to set up. üòç


- *End users can more easily self-serve if they stray from the beaten path*

  Server-oriented software is more likely to be open source than desktop-oriented software and therefore easier to package.


Furthermore, NixOS possesses several unique advantages compared to other server-oriented operating systems:

- *NixOS can be managed entirely declaratively*

  You can manage every single aspect of a NixOS server using a single, uniform, declarative option system.  This goes hand-in-hand with [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops) for managing a fleet of machines (which I'll cover in a future chapter).


- *NixOS upgrades are fast, safe and reliable*

  Upgrades are atomic, meaning that you can't leave a system in an unrecoverable state by canceling the upgrade midway (e.g. `Ctrl-C` or loss of power).  You can also build the desired system ahead of time if you want to ensure that the upgrade is quick and smooth.


- *NixOS systems are lean, lean, lean*

  If you like Alpine Linux then you'll *love* NixOS.  NixOS systems tend to be very light on disk, memory, and CPU resources because you only pay for what you use.  You can achieve astonishingly small system footprints whether you run services natively on the host or inside of containers.


- *NixOS systems have better security-related defaults*

  You get several security improvements for free or almost free by virtue of using NixOS.  For example, your system's footprint is immutable and internal references to filepaths or executables are almost always fully qualified.


## On-premises vs. Software as a service

"Server operating systems" is still a fairly broad category and we can narrow things down further depending on where we deploy the server:

- *On-premises ("on-prem" for short)*

  "On-premises" software runs within the within the end user's environment.  For example, if the software product is a server then an on-premises deployment runs within the customer's data center, either as a virtual machine or a rack server.


- *Software as a service ("SaaS" for short)*

  The opposite of on-premises is "off-premises" (more commonly known as "software as a service").  This means that you centrally host your software, either in your data center or in the cloud, and customers interact with the software via a web interface or API.


NixOS is better suited for SaaS than on-prem deployments, because NixOS fares worse in restricted network environments where network access is limited or unavailable.

You can still deploy NixOS for on-prem deployments and I will cover that in a later chapter, but you will have a much better time using NixOS for SaaS deployments.

## Virtualization

You might be interested in how NixOS fares with respect to virtualization or containers, so I'll break things down into these four potential use cases:

- *NixOS without virtualization*

  You can run NixOS on a bare metal machine (e.g. a desktop or rack server) without any virtual machines or containers.  This implies that services run directly on the bare metal machine.


- *NixOS as a host operating system*

  You can also run NixOS on a bare metal machine (i.e the "host") but then on that machine you run containers or virtual machines (i.e. the "guests").  Typically, you do this if you want services to run inside the guest machines.


- *NixOS as a guest operating system*

  Virtual machines or [OS containers](https://blog.risingstack.com/operating-system-containers-vs-application-containers/) can run a full-fledged operating system inside of them, which can itself be a NixOS operating system.  I consider this similar in spirit to the "NixOS without virtualization" case above because in both cases the services are managed by NixOS.


- *Application containers*

  Containers technically do not need to run an entire operating system and can instead run a single process (e.g. one service).  You can do this using Nixpkgs, which provides support for building application containers.


So which use cases are NixOS/Nixpkgs well-suited for?  If I had to rank these deployment models then my preference (in descending order) would be:

- *NixOS as a guest operating system*

  Specifically, this means that you would run NixOS as a virtual machine on a cloud provider (e.g. AWS) and all of your services run within that NixOS guest machine with no intervening containers.

  I prefer this because this is the leanest deployment model and the lowest maintenance to administer.


- *NixOS without virtualization*

  This typically entails running NixOS on a bare-metal rack server and you still use NixOS to manage all of your services without containers.

  This can potentially be the most cost-effective deployment model if you're willing to manage your own hardware (including RAID and backup/restore) or you operate your own data center.


- *NixOS as a host operating system - Static containers*

  NixOS also works well when you want to statically specify a set of containers to run.  You can run Docker containers or OCI containers just fine, but NixOS particularly excels at running things inside "NixOS containers" (which are `systemd-nspawn` containers under the hood) or application containers built by Nixpkgs.

  I rank this lower than "NixOS without virtualization" because NixOS obviates some (but not all) of the reasons for using containers.  In other words, once you switch to using NixOS you might find that you can do just fine without containers.


- *NixOS as a host operating system - Dynamic containers*

  You can also use NixOS to run containers dynamically, but NixOS is not special in this regard.  At best, NixOS might simplify administering a container orchestration service (e.g.  `kubernetes`), but that alone might not justify the switching costs of using NixOS.


- *Application containers sans NixOS*

  This is technically a use case for Nixpkgs and not NixOS, but I mention it for completeness.  Application containers built by Nixpkgs work best if you are trying to introduce the Nix ecosystem (but not NixOS) within a legacy environment.

  However, you lose out on the benefits of using NixOS because, well, you're no longer using NixOS.


## The killer app for NixOS

Based on the above guidelines, we can outline the ideal use case for NixOS:

- NixOS shines as a server operating system for SaaS deployments

- Services should preferably be statically defined via the NixOS configuration

- NixOS can containerize these services, but it's simpler to skip the containers

If your deployment model matches that outline then NixOS is not only a safe choice, but likely the best choice!  You will be in great company if you use NixOS in this way.

You can still use NixOS in other capacities, but the further you depart from the above "killer app" the more you will need to roll up your sleeves.

## Profile of a NixOS adopter

NixOS is a [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) tool, meaning that NixOS blurs the boundary between software development and operations.

The reason why NixOS fits the DevOps space so well is because NixOS unifies all aspects of managing a system through the uniform NixOS options interface.  In other words, you can use NixOS options to configure operational details (e.g.  RAID, encryption, boot loaders) and also software development details (e.g.  dependency versions, patches, and even small amounts of inline code).

This means that a DevOps engineer or DevOps team is best situated to introduce NixOS within an engineering organization.

{blurb, class: information}
DevOps is more of a set of cultural practices than a team, but some organizations explicitly create a DevOps team or hire engineers for their DevOps expertise in order support to support tools (like NixOS) that enable those cultural practices.

## What does NixOS replace?

If NixOS is a server operating system, does that mean that NixOS competes with Ubuntu Server, Debian or Fedora?  Not exactly.

NixOS competes more with the Docker ecosystem, meaning that a lot of the value that NixOS adds overlaps with Docker:

- *NixOS supports declarative system specification*

  ‚Ä¶ analogous to `docker compose`.


- *NixOS provides better service isolation*

  ‚Ä¶ analogous to containers.


- *NixOS uses the Nix package manager to declaratively assemble software*

  ‚Ä¶ analogous to `Dockerfile`s.


So you can think of NixOS as the Docker killer.  The use cases for NixOS overlap substantially with the use cases for the Docker ecosystem.

You *can* use NixOS in conjunction with Docker containers since NixOS supports declaratively launching containers, but you probably want to avoid buying further into the broader Docker ecosystem if you use NixOS.  You don't want to be in a situation where your engineering organization fragments and does everything in two different ways: the NixOS way and the Docker way.

{blurb, class:information}
For those familiar with the Gentoo Linux distribution, **NixOS is like Gentoo, but for Docker**.  Similar to Gentoo, NixOS is an operating system that provides unparalleled control over the machine while targeting use cases and workflows similar to the Docker ecosystem.
