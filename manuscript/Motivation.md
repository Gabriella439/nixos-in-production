# What is NixOS for?

Some NixOS users might try to "convert" others to NixOS using a pitch that goes something like this:

> NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager.  It uses declarative configuration and allows reliable system upgrades.
>
> - [Wikipedia - NixOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS)

This sort of feature-oriented description explains what NixOS *does*, but does not quite explain what NixOS *is for*.  What sort of useful things can you do with NixOS?  When is NixOS the best solution?  What types of projects, teams, or organizations should prefer using NixOS over other the alternatives?

Come to think of it, what *are* the alternatives?  Is NixOS supposed to replace Debian?  Or Docker?  Or Ansible?  Or Vagrant?  Where does NixOS fit in within the modern software landscape?

In this chapter I'll help you better understand where you can warmly recommend NixOS to others and (just as important!) where you should gently nudge people away from NixOS.  Hopefully this chapter will improve your overall understanding of NixOS's "niche".

We can begin to narrow down the use cases for NixOS by comparing two broad operating system categories: desktop versus server.

## Desktop vs. Server

The title of this book might have tipped you off that I will endorse NixOS for use as a server operating system rather than a desktop operating system.

In my view, NixOS does not cut it as a desktop operating system because:

- NixOS expects users to be developers who are more hands-on with their system

  NixOS does not come preinstalled on most computers and the installation guide assumes quite a bit of technical proficiency (such as comfort partitioning one's drive).  Also, NixOS can only be configured via text files and upgrades are issued from the command line.

- Nixpkgs doesn't enjoy mainstream support for desktop-oriented applications

  ‚Ä¶ such as games or productivity tools.  Nixpkgs is a fairly large software distribution, especially compared to other Linux software distributions, but most desktop applications will not support the Nix ecosystem out-of-the-box and non-technical users rely on experts to package things on their behalf.

- The NixOS user experience differs from what most desktop users expect

  Most desktop users (especially non-technical users) expect to install packages by either downloading the package from the publisher's web page or by visiting an App Store of some sort.  They don't expect to modify a text configuration file in order to install package.

However, the above limitations don't apply when using NixOS as a server operating system:

- Servers are managed by technical users comfortable with command-line interfaces

  Server operating systems are often [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer) machines that only support a command-line interface.  In fact, a typical Ops team would likely frown upon managing a server any other way.

- Nixpkgs provides amazing support for server-oriented software and services

  `nginx`, `postgres`, `redis`, ‚Ä¶ you name it, Nixpkgs most likely has the service you need and it's a dream to set up. üòç

- End users can more easily self-serve if they stray from the beaten path

  Nixpkgs does a great job of packaging server-oriented software and services; the coverage and quality are both great.

Furthermore, NixOS possesses several unique advantages compared to other server-oriented operating systems:

- NixOS can be managed entirely declaratively

  You can manage every single aspect of a NixOS server using a single, uniform, declarative option system.  This works incredibly well with [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops) for managing a fleet of machines (which I'll cover in a future chapter).

- NixOS upgrades are fast, safe and reliable

  Upgrades are atomic, meaning that you can't leave a system in an unrecoverable state by canceling the upgrade midway (e.g. `Ctrl-C`, loss of power).  You can also build the desired system ahead of time if you want to ensure that the upgrade is quick and smooth.

- NixOS systems are lean, lean, lean

  If you like Alpine Linux then you'll *love* NixOS.  NixOS systems tend to be very light on disk, memory, and CPU resources because you only pay for what you use.  You can achieve astonishingly small system footprints whether you run services natively on the host or inside of containers.

- NixOS systems are more secure by default

  You get several security improvements for free or almost free by virtue of using NixOS.  For example, your system's footprint is immutable and internal references to filepaths or executables are almost always fully qualified.

## On-premises vs. Software as a service

"Server operating systems" is still a fairly broad category and we can narrow things down further to where we deploy the server:

- On-premises ("on-prem" for short)

  "On-premises" software runs within the within the end user's environment.  For example, if the software product is a server then an on-premises deployment runs within the customer's data center, either as a virtual machine or a rack server.

- Software as a service ("SaaS" for short)

  The opposite of on-premises is "off-premises" (more commonly known as "software as a service").  This means that you centrally host your software, either in your data center or in the cloud, and customers interact with the software via a web interface or API.

NixOS is better suited for SaaS than on-prem deployments, because NixOS fares worse when deployed on-premises in restricted network environments, meaning that network access is limited or unavailable.

You can deploy NixOS in restricted network environments and I will cover that in a later chapter, but you will have a much better time using NixOS to host software as a service.

## TODO:

- Explain why not to endorse NixOS for immature use cases.
