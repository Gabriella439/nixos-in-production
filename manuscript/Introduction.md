# Introduction

This book is a guide to using NixOS in production, where NixOS is an operating system built on top of the Nix package manager.

This guide assumes some familiarity with the Nix ecosystem, so if you have never used NixOS or the Nix package manager before then this book might not be an effective learning resource for you.  Some chapters will review basic concepts, but they will not be written for a beginner audience; meanwhile, other chapters will cover more advanced topics.

However, this book will appeal to you if you wish to answer the following questions:

- What real-world use cases does NixOS address better than the alternatives?
- What does a mature NixOS enterprise look like?
- How do I smoothly migrate an organization to adopt NixOS?
- What potential pitfalls of NixOS should I be mindful to avoid?
- How can I effectively support and debug NixOS when things go wrong?

I'm writing this book because I cultivated years of professional experience doing all of the above, back when no such resource existed.  Along the way, I accumulated numerous scars from my trial by fire and I'm writing this book so that you don't have to recapitulate the same mistakes I did.

Currently, most educational resources for NixOS (including the NixOS manual) are written with desktop users in mind, whereas (in my view) NixOS is far better suited as a production operating system.  This book attempts to fill that documentation gap by catering to professional NixOS users instead of hobbyists.

Continue reading on if you want to use NixOS "for real" and build a career around one of the hottest emerging DevOps technologies.  This book will improve your NixOS proficiency so that you can deliver noticeable improvements to your organization's operational maturity and reliability.
