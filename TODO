  - Flakes
    - How to query NixOS options using `nix eval`
  - Setup
    - How to upgrade everyone within an organization to the same pinned version
      of Nix
- New chapters
  - Remote builders
  - Integration testing (i.e. NixOS tests)
  - Talk about garbage collection and how GC roots work
    - Also buildtime vs runtime dependencies
  - How to write your own deploy tool
    - i.e. the same as my "NixOS in production" post
    - or maybe just teach people how to use `nixos-rebuild` as a deploy tool
    - Nix under the hood / Interpretation pipeline
      - Evaluation / Instantiation
      - Derivations
      - Realization
      - Example: Building your own distributed build system

    - Docker containers
    - NixOS containers
    - OCI containers
    - Talk about virtualization
      - Host OS
      - Guest OS
      - Application containers
  - Generating AMIs
  - Talk about how to work around restricted network environments
    - i.e. on-premise deployments
  - How to author your own NixOS service

Low priority:

- Using Hydra (even if it is shitty)
- Other forms of testing, too (e.g. Nix builds as tests)
  - Serving test results
- Scaling
  - Instantiation
- Project layout - code organization best practices
- Limitations of rollbacks
- Security
  - Software supply chain security
  - Security hardening flags
  - Securing NixOS

Unprioritized:

- Important NixOS options

- Go into more detail about what the adoption model looks like
- Setting up distributed builds architecture
- Debugging Nix
  - `nix show-derivation`
  - `nix-diff`
  - Debugging errors
  - Understanding NixOS modules and overlays (possibly its own section)
- Mine old blog posts, presentations, and tweets for material
- Caching

  - Uploading to a cache
- NixOS system administration
  - Brief systemd tutorial
- How to distribute and install a patched Nix build

- Read through various nix CLI commands to see if new functionality was added
- Talk about using stock NixOS services instead of containers
- Add exercises?

Things to edit for:

- Publish release of repository for templates
- Consistent Nix version
- Consistent Nixpkgs version
- Correct syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Things that sound like bullshit
